# Midterm Documentation

For my project, I used the MySQL Sakila database which houses data on the inventory and transactions of a video store. Using this database, I decided to model the retail sales at the stores.

To get the sakila database on my local machine, I downloaded the "sakila database" zip file from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html) and extracted it to my C: Downloads folder. Then I went into my instance of MySQL Workbench, clicked "Server" > "Data Import" > "Import from Self-Contained File," and I navigated to the "sakila-schema" file in my Downloads folder and clicked "Open" and "Start Import." Then I clicked the refresh schema button under the navigator and made the new schema the default. Then I selected "File" > "Open SQL Script" and navigated to the "sakila-data" file in my Downloads folder and clicked "Open" and executed the script to populate the schema.

### Process documentation
In this repository, the Jupyter file contains a script where my process for each requirement is documented.
